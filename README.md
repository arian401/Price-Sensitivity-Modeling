##  Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will **continue buying after a price increase**, helping booking platforms (e.g., Expedia, Kayak) personalize pricing in real-time.

It combines a **FastAPI-based machine learning model**, a **Streamlit frontend**, and a **stub backend** to simulate real-world pricing engines.

##  How It Works

- **Data:** Simulated travel customer behavior with 9 features.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression pipeline (scikit-learn), exportable via `joblib`.
- **API:** Receives JSON with 9 features, returns:
  ```json
  {
    "will_buy_after_price_increase": 1,
    "probability": 0.8234
  }
  ```
- **Streamlit App:** Interactive UI to test predictions manually or in batches.
- **Stub Backend:** Simulates an e-commerce pricing server using real-time predictions.

##  Sample Input (Customer)

```json
{
  "total_spent": 2005.79,
  "avg_order_value": 629.24,
  "avg_purchase_frequency": 1.1,
  "days_since_last_purchase": 45,
  "discount_behavior": 0.0,
  "loyalty_program_member": 1,
  "days_in_advance": 3,
  "flight_type": "domestic",
  "cabin_class": "economy"
}
```

##  Skills Demonstrated

- FastAPI and Pydantic for ML APIs  
- Streamlit dashboarding  
- Docker for reproducible deployment  
- CI integration with GitHub Actions  
- Real-time prediction architecture  
- Model versioning with `joblib` and `.env` config  
- ML engineering + deployment (ready for MLOps projects) ✅

---

##  CI: Integration Test

Every push to the repo runs `test_api.py` to confirm that:
- The deployed `/predict` endpoint is live
- Response contains expected keys
- Status code = 200

Workflow: [.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml)
